# DoomFire

## Purpose

 - Look cool
 - Look mostly like the fire effect from Doom PSX (and N64).
   - This mostly started off following Fabien Sanglard's article [How Doom Fire Was Done](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html).
   - I've taken liberties however.
 - Be educational to me
 - Be easy to read
 - To grow

## Dependencies

I mostly develop on Linux without much consideration for other platforms. Please let me know if there are issues or notes that would make developing this application on Windows or Mac easier.

- DoomFire depends on features found in the `C++14` spec.
  - Some minor changes could probably bring that down to 11.
