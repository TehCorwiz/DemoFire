# DoomFire

## Purpose

This repo is my attempt to re-implement the fire effect from Doom PSX (and N64). This follows Fabien Sanglard's article [How Doom Fire Was Done](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html).

CMake is set to use the C++14 spec, although it doesn't depend on that version, c++11 would work just as well, possibly '99.

The project depends on:
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) which is available in the Ubuntu and Fedora package repositories.
- [args.hxx](https://github.com/Taywee/args)
